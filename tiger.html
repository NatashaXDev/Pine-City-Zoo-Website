          <h3>TIGER</h3>
          <p>
            The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest member of the cat family
            and one of the most iconic animals in the world. With its bold black
            stripes over fiery orange fur, the tiger is a symbol of strength,
            agility, and raw power. Native to parts of Asia, tigers inhabit a
            variety of environments, from dense forests and mangrove swamps to
            grasslands and even snowy mountains.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tigers are solitary animals and expert hunters, relying on stealth,
            strength, and powerful senses to catch their prey. A single adult
            tiger can consume up to 40 kg of meat in one night, often feeding on
            deer, wild boar, and other large mammals. Despite their fearsome
            reputation, tigers are incredibly graceful and are known to swim
            long distances, a unique trait among big cats.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sadly, all tiger subspecies are either endangered or critically
            endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and conflict with humans.
            Zoos and wildlife conservation programs play a vital role in
            protecting these magnificent animals through breeding programs,
            habitat preservation efforts, and public education. At our zoo, you
            can witness the majesty of the tiger up close and learn what weâ€™re
            doing to ensure a future for this extraordinary predator.
          </p>
          <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p>
          <p>
            You will find the monkeys at the monkey cage near the Monkey Trail.
